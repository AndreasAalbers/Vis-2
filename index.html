        <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;">It is crucial to stay informed about global events because our interconnected world makes every development, no matter 
            how distant, relevant to our lives. Understanding what is happening around the globe enables us to make informed decisions, whether it be in politics, economics, 
            or even our personal lives.

                (per kilometre squared). The darker shades of blue indicate a higher density count, providing an immediate visual indicator of which parts of the globe hold a larger population.

            <h2>Infant Mortality Rate vs GDP per capita</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;">Infant Mortality Rate and GDP per capita are two distinct but interconnected measures used to assess a countries overall well-being. 
                The Infant Mortality Rate, expressed as the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births, provides insight into the quality of healthcare, sanitation, and social conditions in 
                a nation. 
                <br><br>
                GDP per capita represents the average income per person in a country, which is indicative of its economic prosperity. There is often an inverse relationship between 
                these two measures; higher GDP per capita tends to be associated with lower infant mortality rates.

            <h2>A look into unemployment rates</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;"> 
                Unemployment rates are another important concept which indicate how well a country is travelling. Unemployment is a measure of workers who want to work but are unable to 
                find jobs. 
                <br><br>
                By having a high unemployment rate, the country will have a lower economic output. Furthermore, a very low unemployment rate can also have negative consequences 
                such as inflation and reduced productivity. 
                <br><br> 
                Countries such as South Africa and Iraq can be seen to have much higher rates when compared to other countries such as Vietnam 
                and Ethiopia.</p>

          <h2>Which countries pollute the most?</h2>
          <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;"> CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions per capita are measured as the total amount of CO2 divided by the total population. 
            Countries which gain energy from renewables have much lower CO2 emissions compared to countries which do not. Countries which are rich in oil are also high due to 
            oil refining. 
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, some of the richer countries have high CO2 emissions due to imports from other countries. Canada had the highest CO2 emissions per capita 
            at 14.86 metric tons while India had the lowest at 1.895.

            <h2>Minimum Wage across the globe</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;">Minimum wage is the lowest legally mandated hourly wage that employers are required to pay their workers. It is a fundamental labor policy tool 
                used by governments to ensure that workers receive a fair and liveable income. It helps safeguard workers from exploitative labor practices, reduces income inequality, and provides a basic 
                standard of living.
